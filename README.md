# Twinverse Technology - Lighting Estimation Project

## Objective
Develop a machine learning-based lighting estimation model that verifies optimal lighting conditions when a camera is activated.

## Project Overview
This project implements a real-time lighting estimation system using web technologies, providing instant visual feedback on lighting conditions.

## Technical Requirements
- Language: Python (Backend Analysis)
- Frontend: HTML5, JavaScript
- Lighting Estimation Technique: Computer Vision and Advanced Image Processing

## Key Features
- Real-time lighting condition detection
- Multiple lighting state classifications
- Visual feedback mechanism
- Web-based interface

## Lighting Condition Classifications
1. Dark Environment
2. Low Ambient Light
3. Uneven Lighting
4. Bright Direct Light
5. Soft, Diffused Light
6. Optimal Lighting

## Technical Approach
### Image Processing Techniques
- Pixel-level brightness analysis
- Variance calculation
- Comprehensive lighting metric computation

### Detection Methodology
- Webcam frame capture
- Real-time image data processing
- Advanced lighting condition classification
